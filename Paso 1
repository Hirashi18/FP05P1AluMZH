Ada Lovelace 
Augusta Ada King, Condesa de Lovelace, (nacida
Augusta Ada Byron en Londres, 10 de diciembre de
1815 - Londres, 27 de noviembre de 1852), conocida
habitualmente como Ada Lovelace, fue una
matemática y escritora británica conocida
principalmente por su trabajo sobre la máquina
calculadora mecánica de uso general de Charles
Babbage, la Máquina analítica. Entre sus notas sobre
la máquina se encuentra lo que se reconoce hoy como
el primer algoritmo destinado a ser procesado por una
máquina. Como consecuencia, se la describe a menudo
como la primera programadora de ordenadores.

Charles Babbage
In 1821 an inventor and mathematician, Charles Babbage, was poring over a set of mathematical tables. 
Finding error after error Babbage exclaimed, "I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam." 
His frustration was not simply at the grindingly tedious labor of checking manually evaluated tables, but at their daunting unreliability. 
Science, engineering, construction, banking, and insurance depended on tables for calculation. 
Ships navigating by the stars relied on them to find their positions at sea.

Blaise Pascal

Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, physicist and religious philosopher, who laid the foundation for the modern theory of probabilities.
IN THESE GROUPS

Mathematician Blaise Pascal was born on June 19, 1623, in Clermont-Ferrand, France. In the 1640s he invented the Pascaline, an early calculator.
And further validated Evangelista Torricelli's theory concerning the cause of barometrical variations. 
In the 1650s, Pascal laid the foundation of probability theory with Pierre de Fermat and published the theological work Les Provinciales, a groundbreaking series of letters that defended his Jansenist faith.
Pascal is also widely known for his body of notes posthumously released as the Pensées. He died in Paris on August 19, 1662.
